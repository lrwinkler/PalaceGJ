BUGS TO FIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED Medusa's eyes don't display properly when walking left/right.

FIXED When soldiers are petrified during movement the statue sprite shows up between tiles but it blocks the tile of origin.

FIXED Game Over doesn't take control away from player, can still "Win" after dying (The YOU WIN message is still displayed)

FIXED Enemies sometimes spawn on top of the player if he moves while the YOU WIN message is displayed, resulting in instant death. (probably going to be fixed when selling screen is implemented)

FIXED Player can walk into enemy while petrifying him, resulting in the player and the newly created statue overlapping.

FIXED If an enemy gets petrified during attack animation, the player still dies.

FIXED Enemies can spawn on top of each other and walk into each other. They sometimes stack.

Attack animations don't transition into move animations properly if facing doesn't change.

Attack animations don't stop when player is dead.

Enemy can spawn very close to player at beginning, making death very likely.

Enemies can spawn in locked off areas making finishing a wave impossible. (bug or feature?)

Player can walk into enemy sprite when moving into an area that's the target destination of the enemy. (movement at the same moment as the enemy)

Alert animation doesn't play when enemy is alerted.
