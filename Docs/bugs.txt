BUGS TO FIX
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FIXED Medusa's eyes don't display properly when walking left/right.

FIXED When soldiers are petrified during movement the statue sprite shows up between tiles but it blocks the tile of origin.

FIXED Game Over doesn't take control away from player, can still "Win" after dying (The YOU WIN message is still displayed)

FIXED Enemies sometimes spawn on top of the player if he moves while the YOU WIN message is displayed, resulting in instant death. (probably going to be fixed when selling screen is implemented)

Enemy can spawn very close to player at beginning, making death very likely

Enemies can spawn on top of each other and sometimes stack.
